## 1.1 Purpose

This protocol provides evidence-based guidance for antiseizure medication (ASM) selection across all patient populations and seizure types. It integrates recommendations from major international guidelines including ILAE, AAN/AES, and NICE.

---

## 1.2 Terminology

Per ILAE 2024 recommendations, the term **"antiseizure medication" (ASM)** replaces "antiepileptic drug" (AED) to accurately reflect that these medications control seizures but do not cure epilepsy.

## 1.3 General Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Monotherapy first** | Initial treatment should aim for monotherapy |
| **Start low, go slow** | Begin at low dose and titrate gradually |
| **Seizure type matters** | ASM selection must match seizure classification |
| **Individualize** | Consider comorbidities, age, sex, and drug interactions |
| **Reassess regularly** | Evaluate efficacy and tolerability at each visit |
