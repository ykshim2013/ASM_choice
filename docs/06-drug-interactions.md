## 6.1 CYP450 Enzyme Effects

### 6.1.1 Strong Enzyme Inducers

| ASM | Enzymes Induced | Clinical Impact |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Phenobarbital** | CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, UGT | Reduces levels of most other drugs |
| **Phenytoin** | CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, UGT | Reduces levels of most other drugs |
| **Carbamazepine** | CYP1A2, 2C9, 3A4, UGT | Reduces levels of most other drugs |
| **Primidone** | Same as phenobarbital | Metabolized to phenobarbital |

### 6.1.2 Moderate/Weak Enzyme Inducers

| ASM | Enzymes Induced | Clinical Impact |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Oxcarbazepine** | CYP3A4 (weak) | Reduces oral contraceptive efficacy |
| **Topiramate** (≥200 mg/day) | CYP3A4 | Reduces oral contraceptive efficacy |
| **Eslicarbazepine** | CYP3A4 (weak) | Reduces oral contraceptive efficacy |
| **Felbamate** | CYP3A4 (weak) | Also inhibits CYP2C19 |
| **Rufinamide** | CYP3A4 (weak) | Modest induction |

### 6.1.3 Enzyme Inhibitors

| ASM | Enzymes Inhibited | Clinical Impact |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Valproate** | CYP2C9, UGT | Increases lamotrigine, phenobarbital levels |
| **Felbamate** | CYP2C19, β-oxidation | Increases phenytoin, valproate levels |
| **Stiripentol** | CYP1A2, 2C19, 3A4 | Multiple drug interactions |
| **Cannabidiol** | CYP2C19, 3A4 | Increases clobazam metabolite |

### 6.1.4 No Significant CYP Interactions

| ASM | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| **Levetiracetam** | Preferred when polypharmacy |
| **Gabapentin** | No hepatic metabolism |
| **Pregabalin** | No hepatic metabolism |
| **Lacosamide** | Minimal CYP involvement |
| **Brivaracetam** | Minimal CYP involvement |

## 6.2 ASM-ASM Interactions

| Combination | Effect | Management |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Valproate + Lamotrigine** | LTG level ↑↑ (2-3x) | Reduce LTG dose 50%; slow titration |
| **Carbamazepine + Lamotrigine** | LTG level ↓↓ | Increase LTG dose |
| **Phenytoin + Valproate** | Complex: PHT free ↑, total ↓ | Monitor free PHT level |
| **Carbamazepine + Valproate** | CBZ-epoxide ↑ (toxicity) | Monitor for CBZ toxicity |
| **Felbamate + Valproate** | VPA level ↑ | Reduce VPA dose |
| **Cannabidiol + Clobazam** | N-desmethylclobazam ↑↑ | Reduce clobazam dose |

---

## 6.3 ASM-Non-ASM Interactions

| ASM | Interacting Drug | Effect | Management |
|-----|------------------|--------|------------|
| **Enzyme inducers** | Oral contraceptives | Contraceptive failure | Use ≥50 mcg ethinyl estradiol or alternative method |
| **Enzyme inducers** | Warfarin | Reduced anticoagulation | INR monitoring; dose adjustment |
| **Enzyme inducers** | DOACs | Reduced efficacy | Avoid combination or use alternative |
| **Enzyme inducers** | Statins | Reduced efficacy | May need dose increase |
| **Enzyme inducers** | Immunosuppressants | Subtherapeutic levels | Use non-inducing ASM |
| **Enzyme inducers** | Chemotherapy | Reduced efficacy | Use non-inducing ASM |
| **Valproate** | Carbapenem antibiotics | VPA level ↓↓ (75-90%) | **AVOID combination** |
| **Carbamazepine** | Macrolide antibiotics | CBZ toxicity | Monitor; use azithromycin |
| **Carbamazepine** | Azole antifungals | CBZ toxicity | Monitor CBZ level |
| **Gabapentin** | Antacids | Gabapentin ↓ 20% | Separate by 2 hours |

## 6.4 Contraceptive Considerations

| ASM Category | Effect on Hormonal Contraceptives | Recommendation |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **Strong inducers** (PHT, PB, CBZ, PRM) | Significant reduction in efficacy | IUD, depot medroxyprogesterone, or barrier methods |
| **Moderate inducers** (OXC, TPM ≥200 mg, ESL) | Reduced efficacy | Same as above |
| **No effect** (VPA, LEV, LTG, GBP, PGB, LCM, BRV) | No reduction | Standard contraceptives OK |
| **Lamotrigine** | OCs reduce LTG levels 40-60% | Adjust LTG dose with OC changes |

### Lamotrigine-Oral Contraceptive Interaction

```
Starting OC → LTG levels ↓ 40-60% → May need to ↑ LTG dose
Stopping OC → LTG levels ↑ → May need to ↓ LTG dose

During pill-free week:
├── LTG levels fluctuate
└── Consider continuous OC regimen for stability
```

## 6.5 High-Risk Drug Combinations

### Absolute Contraindications

| Combination | Risk | Alternative |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Valproate + Carbapenems** | VPA levels drop 75-90% within 24h | Use different antibiotic class |

### Relative Contraindications

| Combination | Risk | Management |
|-------------|------|------------|
| Enzyme inducers + DOACs | Therapeutic failure | Use warfarin with monitoring or non-inducing ASM |
| Enzyme inducers + HIV antiretrovirals | Treatment failure | Use non-inducing ASM |
| Enzyme inducers + Transplant immunosuppressants | Rejection risk | Use non-inducing ASM |

## 6.6 Safe Combinations for Polypharmacy

When patients require multiple medications, prefer ASMs with minimal interaction potential:

| ASM | Interaction Risk | Best For |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| **Levetiracetam** | Very Low | Polypharmacy, oncology, transplant |
| **Gabapentin** | Very Low | Elderly with multiple medications |
| **Pregabalin** | Very Low | Chronic pain + epilepsy |
| **Lacosamide** | Low | Cardiac-safe option |
| **Brivaracetam** | Low | Alternative to levetiracetam |
