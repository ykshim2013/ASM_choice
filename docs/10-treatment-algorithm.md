## 10.1 General Treatment Approach

```
STEP 1: CONFIRM DIAGNOSIS
├── Epilepsy confirmed by clinical history ± EEG
├── Classify seizure type (focal, generalized, unknown)
└── Identify epilepsy syndrome if possible

STEP 2: ASSESS PATIENT FACTORS
├── Age (pediatric, adult, elderly)
├── Sex and childbearing potential
├── Comorbidities (psychiatric, cardiac, renal, hepatic)
├── Current medications (interaction potential)
└── Patient preferences (dosing frequency, side effects)

STEP 3: SELECT FIRST-LINE ASM
├── Match to seizure type (see Section 3)
├── Consider special populations (see Section 4)
├── Avoid contraindicated ASMs
└── Discuss expectations and side effects

STEP 4: INITIATE AND TITRATE
├── Start low, titrate slowly
├── Target lowest effective dose
└── Monotherapy is the goal

STEP 5: ASSESS RESPONSE (After adequate trial: 2-3 months at therapeutic dose)
│
├── SEIZURE-FREE → Continue current regimen
│   └── Consider driving, lifestyle counseling
│
├── REDUCED SEIZURES but not seizure-free
│   ├── Optimize current ASM (increase dose if tolerated)
│   └── If optimized and still seizing → Step 6
│
└── NO IMPROVEMENT or INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS → Step 6

STEP 6: FIRST MONOTHERAPY FAILURE
├── Option A: Switch to alternative first-line ASM (cross-titration)
└── Option B: Add second ASM (rational polytherapy)
    └── Consider mechanisms of action, interaction profile

STEP 7: SECOND MONOTHERAPY/DUOTHERAPY FAILURE
├── Consider drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) if failed 2 appropriate ASMs
├── Refer to comprehensive epilepsy center
├── Evaluate for:
│   ├── Surgical candidacy
│   ├── Neurostimulation (VNS, RNS, DBS)
│   └── Dietary therapy (ketogenic diet)
└── Continue to optimize medical therapy

STEP 8: ONGOING MANAGEMENT
├── Regular follow-up (every 3-12 months when stable)
├── Monitor for side effects
├── Reassess need for continued therapy (consider withdrawal after 2+ seizure-free years)
└── Address comorbidities and quality of life
```

## 10.2 Drug-Resistant Epilepsy (DRE) Definition

> **ILAE Definition:** Failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used ASM schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom.

### When to Refer to Epilepsy Center

- Failed 2 appropriate ASMs
- Unclear seizure classification
- Diagnostic uncertainty
- Considering pregnancy
- Candidate for surgery or neurostimulation
- Status epilepticus

---

## 10.3 ASM Switching Strategies

### Cross-Titration Method (Preferred)

```
Week 1-2: Start new ASM at low dose
Week 3-4: Increase new ASM to low-therapeutic dose
Week 5-6: Begin tapering old ASM
Week 7-8: Continue increasing new ASM while tapering old ASM
Week 9+: Complete taper of old ASM; optimize new ASM
```

### Direct Switch (For Urgent Situations Only)

- Stop old ASM and start new ASM at therapeutic dose
- Higher risk of breakthrough seizures
- Use only if intolerable side effects require immediate discontinuation

---

## 10.4 Rational Polytherapy Principles

### Complementary Mechanisms of Action

| Mechanism | ASMs |
|-----------|------|
| **Sodium channel blockers** | Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Phenytoin, Lacosamide, Lamotrigine |
| **Calcium channel modulators** | Ethosuximide, Gabapentin, Pregabalin |
| **GABA enhancement** | Benzodiazepines, Phenobarbital, Vigabatrin, Tiagabine |
| **SV2A binding** | Levetiracetam, Brivaracetam |
| **Multiple mechanisms** | Valproate, Topiramate, Zonisamide |
| **AMPA antagonist** | Perampanel |

### Effective Combinations

| Combination | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Lamotrigine + Valproate | Synergistic (but watch LTG levels) |
| Sodium channel blocker + SV2A binder | Different mechanisms |
| Sodium channel blocker + Perampanel | Complementary targets |

### Combinations to Avoid

| Combination | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Two sodium channel blockers | Additive CNS toxicity |
| Valproate + Carbamazepine | Interaction increases CBZ-epoxide toxicity |
| Multiple sedating ASMs | Excessive CNS depression |

## 10.5 ASM Withdrawal Considerations

### When to Consider Withdrawal

- Seizure-free ≥2 years
- Normal EEG
- Normal neuroimaging
- No underlying progressive condition
- Patient preference and risk tolerance

### Factors Favoring Continued Therapy

- Abnormal EEG
- Structural brain lesion
- Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (high relapse rate)
- History of status epilepticus
- High-risk occupation/driving

### Withdrawal Protocol

```
If proceeding with withdrawal:
├── Taper slowly over 2-6 months
├── Reduce by 25% every 2-4 weeks
├── Monitor for breakthrough seizures
├── Counsel about driving restrictions during withdrawal
└── Have plan for restarting if seizures recur
```

## 10.6 Decision Tree: Focal Seizures

```
FOCAL SEIZURES
│
├── ADULT
│   ├── First-line: Lamotrigine or Levetiracetam
│   ├── If psychiatric history → Prefer Lamotrigine
│   ├── If rapid loading needed → Prefer Levetiracetam
│   └── Alternatives: OXC, CBZ, LCM, ZNS
│
├── ELDERLY (≥65)
│   ├── First-line: Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam, or Gabapentin
│   ├── Avoid: Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine
│   └── Consider: Reduced dosing, drug interactions
│
├── FEMALE OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL
│   ├── First-line: Lamotrigine or Levetiracetam
│   ├── Counsel: Contraception, preconception planning
│   └── Avoid: Valproate, Topiramate
│
└── PEDIATRIC
    ├── Infant: Levetiracetam, Phenobarbital
    ├── Child: Oxcarbazepine, Levetiracetam
    └── Adolescent: Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam
```

---

## 10.7 Decision Tree: Generalized Seizures

```
GENERALIZED SEIZURES
│
├── TONIC-CLONIC
│   ├── Male: Valproate (first-line)
│   ├── Female (childbearing potential): LEV or LTG
│   └── Elderly: LEV or LTG
│
├── ABSENCE
│   ├── Childhood absence: Ethosuximide or Valproate
│   ├── Juvenile absence: Valproate or Lamotrigine
│   └── Avoid: CBZ, GBP, PHT, OXC (may worsen)
│
├── MYOCLONIC
│   ├── First-line: Valproate, Levetiracetam
│   ├── Avoid: CBZ, OXC, PHT, GBP
│   └── Caution: LTG may exacerbate
│
└── TONIC/ATONIC
    ├── First-line: Lamotrigine, Valproate
    └── Adjunctive: Rufinamide, Clobazam
```

## 10.8 Quick Reference: When to Use Each ASM

| ASM | Best For | Avoid In |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **Levetiracetam** | Rapid loading, polypharmacy, pregnancy | Significant psychiatric history |
| **Lamotrigine** | Women of childbearing age, depression | When rapid control needed (slow titration) |
| **Valproate** | JME, GTC (males), broad-spectrum | Pregnancy, liver disease, women of childbearing age |
| **Carbamazepine** | Focal epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia | Generalized epilepsy, cardiac disease, Asian ancestry |
| **Oxcarbazepine** | Focal epilepsy, better tolerated than CBZ | Hyponatremia risk, Asian ancestry |
| **Ethosuximide** | Absence seizures only | Any seizure type except absence |
| **Topiramate** | Weight loss desirable, migraine comorbidity | Pregnancy, cognitive concerns |
| **Gabapentin** | Elderly, neuropathic pain comorbidity | Generalized epilepsy |
| **Lacosamide** | Focal epilepsy, good tolerability | Cardiac conduction disorders |
| **Phenytoin** | Acute management, status epilepticus | Long-term use in elderly, pregnancy |
