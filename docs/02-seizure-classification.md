## 2.1 ILAE 2025 Updated Classification (Current)

> **Published:** April 23, 2025 | **Source:** [Epilepsia Position Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.18338)

The ILAE 2025 classification maintains the core framework of 2017 while introducing key clarifications based on real-world implementation experience. A working group of 37 members from all ILAE regions achieved unanimous consensus through a modified Delphi process (7 rounds).

### 2.1.1 Main Seizure Classes (4 Classes, 21 Types)

```

### 2.1.2 Key Changes from 2017 to 2025

| Aspect | 2017 Classification | 2025 Classification |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Terminology** | "Focal-onset," "Generalized-onset," "Unknown-onset" | "Focal," "Generalized," "Unknown" (removed "onset") |
| **Consciousness** | "Awareness" (aware vs impaired awareness) | "Consciousness" (preserved, impaired, unknown) - defined by awareness AND responsiveness |
| **Observable features** | "Motor onset" vs "Non-motor onset" | "With observable manifestations" vs "Without observable manifestations" |
| **Seizure description** | Based on first symptom | Based on chronological sequence of semiology |
| **New seizure type** | — | Epileptic negative myoclonus recognized |
| **Epileptic spasms** | Separate across all classes | Descriptor in focal/unknown; seizure type in generalized |
| **Absence seizures** | Categorized as "nonmotor" | No longer labeled "nonmotor" (often have motor features) |
| **Total seizure types** | 63 types | 21 types (simplified) |

### 2.1.3 Classifiers vs Descriptors (New Taxonomic Concept)

| Category | Definition | Examples | Clinical Impact |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Classifiers** | Reflect biological classes; directly impact management | Consciousness state, seizure class | Guide syndrome diagnosis, ASM selection, prognosis |
| **Descriptors** | Important characteristics; indirectly contribute to management | Somatotopic modifiers (L/R/bilateral), semiological features | Provide clinical detail but don't change ASM choice alone |

### 2.1.4 Consciousness Classification (Replaces "Awareness")

| State | Definition | Assessment |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Preserved** | Awareness AND responsiveness intact | Patient can respond appropriately during seizure |
| **Impaired** | Awareness OR responsiveness compromised | Altered behavior, unresponsive, confused |
| **Unknown** | Cannot be determined | Unwitnessed seizure, inadequate history |

> **Key Change:** Consciousness = Awareness + Responsiveness (both components now required for assessment)

### 2.1.5 Basic vs Expanded Classification

| Version | Use Case | Detail Level |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Basic** | Initial classification, general practice | Seizure class + consciousness + observable manifestations |
| **Expanded** | Epilepsy centers, research, detailed documentation | Full chronological semiological description |

## 2.2 ILAE 2017 Operational Classification (Historical Reference)

> **Note:** Retained for historical reference and comparison. The 2017 framework remains the foundation of the 2025 update.

```

## 2.3 Comparison Summary: 2017 vs 2025

| Feature | 2017 | 2025 | Rationale for Change |
|---------|------|------|---------------------|
| Main class naming | Includes "onset" | Removes "onset" | Simplification; "onset" not always determinable |
| Awareness concept | Binary: Aware/Impaired | Consciousness (preserved/impaired/unknown) | Adds responsiveness component; includes "unknown" option |
| Motor vs Non-motor | Used for focal seizures | Replaced by "observable manifestations" | Motor features often present in "non-motor" seizures (e.g., absences) |
| Semiology description | First symptom defines seizure | Chronological sequence | Better reflects clinical reality |
| Epileptic spasms | Separate type in all classes | Generalized = type; Focal/Unknown = descriptor | Clarifies relationship to focal pathology |
| Negative myoclonus | Not included | New seizure type | Recognized as distinct clinical entity |
| Numbering system | Not standardized | Seizure types numbered | Ensures consistency across databases and languages |

## 2.4 Epilepsy Syndromes Relevant to ASM Selection

### 2.4.1 Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsies (IGEs)

| Syndrome | Age of Onset | Key Features | Preferred ASM | Avoid |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE)** | 4-10 years | Typical absences, 3 Hz spike-wave | Ethosuximide, Valproate | CBZ, OXC, PHT, GBP, PGB, VGB |
| **Juvenile Absence Epilepsy (JAE)** | 10-17 years | Absences less frequent, GTC common | Valproate, Lamotrigine | Same as CAE |
| **Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)** | 12-18 years | Morning myoclonus, GTC, absences | Valproate, LEV, LTG* | CBZ, OXC, PHT, GBP, PGB |
| **Epilepsy with GTC alone** | Variable | GTC only, no other seizure types | Valproate, LEV, LTG | — |

*LTG may exacerbate myoclonic seizures in some JME patients

### 2.4.2 Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs)

| Syndrome | Age of Onset | Key Features | Preferred ASM | Special Considerations |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Dravet Syndrome** | <1 year | Prolonged febrile seizures, SCN1A | VPA, CLB, Stiripentol, **Fenfluramine** (2020/2022), **Cannabidiol** | **AVOID** sodium channel blockers (CBZ, OXC, PHT, LTG) |
| **Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome** | 1-7 years | Multiple seizure types, slow spike-wave | VPA, LTG, Rufinamide, **Fenfluramine** (2022), **Cannabidiol**, **Cenobamate** (off-label) | Often drug-resistant; consider surgery/VNS |
| **CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder** | <6 months | Infantile spasms, SCN1A-negative | **Ganaxolone** (2022), VGB, VPA | First-in-class FDA approval 2022 |
| **Infantile Epileptic Spasms Syndrome** | 3-12 months | Epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia | Vigabatrin (TSC), ACTH/prednisolone | Urgent treatment required |

### 2.4.3 Focal Epilepsy Syndromes

| Syndrome | Location | Key Features | Preferred ASM |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS)** | Rolandic | Focal motor, nocturnal, centrotemporal spikes | Often no Rx; if needed: LEV, CBZ |
| **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy** | Mesial/Lateral temporal | Auras, automatisms, impaired consciousness | LTG, LEV, CBZ, LCM, **Cenobamate** |
| **Frontal Lobe Epilepsy** | Frontal | Hyperkinetic, brief, nocturnal, clusters | LTG, LEV, CBZ, LCM |
| **Occipital Lobe Epilepsy** | Occipital | Visual symptoms, headache | LTG, LEV, CBZ |

## 2.5 Classification Impact on ASM Selection

### 2.5.1 Focal vs Generalized: Key Differences

| Feature | Focal Seizures | Generalized Seizures |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Origin** | One hemisphere | Both hemispheres simultaneously |
| **Consciousness** | May or may not be impaired | Usually impaired (except some absence) |
| **First-line ASM** | Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam | Valproate, Levetiracetam |
| **ASMs to avoid** | None specific | Narrow-spectrum ASMs may worsen |

### 2.5.2 Narrow-Spectrum ASMs (May Exacerbate Generalized/Absence/Myoclonic Seizures)

| ASM | Risk Level | Mechanism |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| Carbamazepine | High | Sodium channel blockade |
| Oxcarbazepine | High | Sodium channel blockade |
| Phenytoin | High | Sodium channel blockade |
| Gabapentin | High | Calcium channel modulation |
| Pregabalin | High | Calcium channel modulation |
| Vigabatrin | Moderate | GABA enhancement |
| Lacosamide | Low-Moderate | Enhanced slow Na+ inactivation |

### 2.5.3 Broad-Spectrum ASMs (Effective for Multiple Seizure Types)

| ASM | Focal | GTC | Absence | Myoclonic | Notes |
|-----|-------|-----|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Valproate** | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | Most broad-spectrum; avoid in pregnancy |
| **Levetiracetam** | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓ | Good safety profile |
| **Lamotrigine** | ✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ⚠️* | May worsen myoclonus in some |
| **Topiramate** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Cognitive effects limit use |
| **Zonisamide** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Broad but less evidence |
| **Perampanel** | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | AMPA antagonist |
| **Brivaracetam** | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | LEV alternative, fewer psychiatric effects |
| **Cenobamate** | ✓✓ | ? | — | — | High efficacy in focal; emerging broad-spectrum data |

✓ = Effective; ✓✓ = Highly effective; ⚠️ = Use with caution; — = Limited data

## 2.6 Neonatal Seizure Classification (ILAE 2021)

> **Note:** Neonatal seizures have a separate classification and are NOT included in the 2025 adult/pediatric update.

| Type | Features | First-Line | Notes |
|------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Electrographic-only** | EEG changes, no clinical signs | Phenobarbital | Most common in neonates |
| **Motor** | Clonic, tonic, myoclonic, spasms | Phenobarbital | May be subtle |
| **Non-motor** | Autonomic, behavior arrest | Phenobarbital | Often unrecognized |
| **Sequential** | Multiple types in sequence | Phenobarbital | Indicates severity |

**ILAE 2023 Neonatal Guidelines Key Points:**
- Phenobarbital is first-line regardless of etiology (Level B evidence)
- Exception: If channelopathy suspected → Phenytoin or Carbamazepine
- Levetiracetam preferred second-line if cardiac disorders present

## 2.7 Practical Classification Guide (2025)

### Step-by-Step Approach

```
STEP 1: Determine Seizure Class
├── Does seizure originate in one hemisphere? → FOCAL
├── Does seizure involve both hemispheres from start? → GENERALIZED
├── Cannot determine origin? → UNKNOWN
└── Inadequate information? → UNCLASSIFIED

STEP 2: For Focal/Unknown - Classify Consciousness
├── Patient aware AND responsive during seizure? → PRESERVED
├── Patient unaware OR unresponsive? → IMPAIRED
└── Cannot determine? → UNKNOWN

STEP 3: For Focal/Unknown - Observable Manifestations
├── Motor activity or other observable signs? → WITH
├── Subjective experience only (aura)? → WITHOUT
└── Cannot determine? → UNKNOWN

STEP 4: For Generalized - Identify Seizure Type
├── Brief staring, 3 Hz spike-wave? → ABSENCE (specify type)
└── Motor manifestations predominate? → MOTOR (specify type)

STEP 5: Add Descriptors (Expanded Version)
├── Somatotopic: Side (L/R/bilateral), body part
├── Semiology: Chronological sequence of features
└── Progression: Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic if applicable
```
