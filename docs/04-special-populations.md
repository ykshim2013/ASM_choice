## 4.1 Pregnancy

### 4.1.1 Teratogenicity Risk Classification

| Risk Category | ASM | MCM Rate | Notes |
|---------------|-----|----------|-------|
| **Lowest Risk** | Levetiracetam | 2-3% | Preferred in pregnancy |
| **Lowest Risk** | Lamotrigine | 2-3% | Monitor levels; dose may need increase |
| **Low Risk** | Oxcarbazepine | 2-3% | Alternative option |
| **Moderate Risk** | Carbamazepine | 4-6% | Neural tube defects, craniofacial anomalies |
| **High Risk** | Topiramate | 3-5% | Oral clefts; 2.5x ID risk |
| **Highest Risk** | Valproate | 5-15% | **CONTRAINDICATED** in pregnancy |

*MCM = Major Congenital Malformations; ID = Intellectual Disability*

### 4.1.2 Neurodevelopmental Risks (2024 Data)

| ASM | Autism Risk | Intellectual Disability | ADHD |
|-----|-------------|------------------------|------|
| **Valproate** | 30-40% NDD risk | Significantly increased | Increased |
| **Topiramate** | Increased | 2.5x increased | - |
| **Carbamazepine** | 1.25x increased | 1.30x increased | - |
| **Lamotrigine** | No significant increase | No significant increase | No significant increase |
| **Levetiracetam** | No significant increase | No significant increase | No significant increase |

*NDD = Neurodevelopmental Disorders*

### 4.1.3 Pregnancy Management Protocol

```
PRE-CONCEPTION (Ideal: 6-12 months before)
├── Switch from high-risk ASM to lamotrigine or levetiracetam
├── Optimize to lowest effective dose
├── Folic acid 4-5 mg/day (high dose if on enzyme inducers)
└── Genetic counseling if appropriate

FIRST TRIMESTER
├── Continue lowest effective ASM dose
├── Avoid valproate and topiramate
├── Monthly ASM level monitoring (especially lamotrigine)
└── Detailed fetal ultrasound at 11-14 weeks

SECOND/THIRD TRIMESTER
├── ASM level monitoring every 4-8 weeks
├── Increase dose if levels drop significantly (lamotrigine ↓40-60%)
├── Anatomy scan at 18-22 weeks
└── Growth scans as indicated

PERIPARTUM
├── Consider IV access for ASM administration
├── Continue ASM; do not skip doses
├── Vitamin K 10 mg IM to neonate if on enzyme inducers
└── Breastfeeding generally safe (except barbiturates, high-dose benzodiazepines)

POSTPARTUM
├── Reduce dose if increased during pregnancy (within 2-3 weeks)
├── Monitor for seizure breakthrough
└── Sleep deprivation precautions
```

### 4.1.4 Preferred Combinations in Pregnancy

Based on 2024 evidence:
- **Lamotrigine + Levetiracetam:** 60% lower MCM risk than valproate monotherapy
- Avoid combining known teratogens (carbamazepine + valproate + topiramate)

## 4.2 Elderly (≥65 years)

### 4.2.1 Preferred ASMs in Elderly

| ASM | Advantages | Considerations |
|-----|------------|----------------|
| **Levetiracetam** | No hepatic metabolism, minimal interactions, IV available | Psychiatric effects, renal dosing |
| **Lamotrigine** | Good tolerability, minimal cognitive effects | Slow titration, rash risk |
| **Gabapentin** | No hepatic metabolism, no interactions | Renal dosing, TID dosing |
| **Lacosamide** | Good tolerability, BID dosing | PR prolongation, avoid in cardiac disease |

### 4.2.2 Dosing Adjustments for Elderly

| ASM | Standard Adult Dose | Elderly Starting Dose | Notes |
|-----|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Levetiracetam | 500 mg BID | 250 mg BID | Adjust for CrCl |
| Lamotrigine | 25 mg daily | 25 mg daily | Same titration, may need lower maintenance |
| Gabapentin | 300 mg TID | 100-300 mg daily | CrCl-based dosing |
| Lacosamide | 50 mg BID | 50 mg BID | Max 300 mg/day in elderly |

### 4.2.3 ASMs to Avoid or Use Cautiously in Elderly

| ASM | Reason to Avoid |
|-----|-----------------|
| Phenytoin | Cognitive effects, drug interactions, osteoporosis |
| Phenobarbital | Sedation, cognitive impairment, enzyme induction |
| Carbamazepine | Hyponatremia (SIADH), cardiac effects, interactions |
| Oxcarbazepine | Higher hyponatremia risk than carbamazepine |
| Topiramate | Cognitive slowing, word-finding difficulty |
| Valproate | Tremor, weight gain, thrombocytopenia |

## 4.3 Renal Impairment

### 4.3.1 ASMs Requiring Dose Adjustment

| ASM | Renal Elimination | Dose Adjustment |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Levetiracetam** | 66% unchanged | CrCl 30-50: 50-75% dose; CrCl <30: 50% dose; HD: supplement |
| **Gabapentin** | 100% unchanged | CrCl 30-60: 50% dose; CrCl 15-30: 25% dose; HD: supplement |
| **Pregabalin** | 98% unchanged | CrCl 30-60: 50% dose; CrCl 15-30: 25% dose |
| **Lacosamide** | 40% unchanged | Mild/Moderate: no change; Severe: max 300 mg/day |
| **Topiramate** | 70% unchanged | CrCl <70: 50% dose |
| **Brivaracetam** | 8% unchanged | No adjustment needed |

### 4.3.2 ASMs Safe in Renal Impairment (No Adjustment Needed)

| ASM | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| Carbamazepine | Hepatic metabolism |
| Valproate | Hepatic metabolism |
| Phenytoin | Hepatic metabolism (but altered protein binding) |
| Lamotrigine | Hepatic glucuronidation |
| Clobazam | Hepatic metabolism |

## 4.4 Hepatic Impairment

### 4.4.1 Preferred ASMs in Hepatic Disease

| ASM | Hepatic Metabolism | Safety in Hepatic Impairment |

| **Gabapentin** | None | **Preferred** - safe |
| **Pregabalin** | None | **Preferred** - safe |
| **Lacosamide** | Moderate | Use with caution; max 300 mg/day in severe |
| Brivaracetam | Partial | Reduce dose in severe impairment |

### 4.4.2 ASMs to Avoid in Hepatic Impairment

| ASM | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Valproate | Hepatotoxic; fatal liver failure risk |
| Phenytoin | Highly protein-bound; unpredictable levels |
| Carbamazepine | Hepatic metabolism; can worsen liver function |
| Felbamate | Hepatotoxicity risk |
| Phenobarbital | Hepatic metabolism; prolonged half-life |
