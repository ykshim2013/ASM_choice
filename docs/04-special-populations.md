## 4.1 Pregnancy

### 4.1.0 AAN/AES/SMFM 2024 Practice Guideline

> **Published:** May 2024 | **Source:** [Neurology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38748979/) | Joint guideline from American Academy of Neurology, American Epilepsy Society, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine

#### Key Recommendations (Evidence-Based)

| Recommendation | Evidence Level | Details |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Use LTG, LEV, or OXC** when appropriate | Level B | Minimize risk of major congenital malformations |
| **Avoid valproic acid** | Level B | Highest risk of MCM (especially neural tube defects) and NDD |
| **Avoid phenobarbital** if possible | Level B | Highest risk of cardiac malformations (4.4%) |
| **Avoid topiramate** if possible | Level B | Risk of oral clefts and lower IQ |
| **Folic acid ≥0.4 mg/day** | Level B | Reduce neural tube defects; improve neurodevelopmental outcomes |
| **Do not stop effective ASM during pregnancy** | Level C | Uncontrolled GTC seizures pose greater risk than most ASMs |
| **Exercise caution replacing effective ASM** once pregnant | Level C | Especially for GTC or focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic |

### 4.1.1 Teratogenicity Risk Classification (2024 Updated Data)

| Risk Category | ASM | MCM Rate | Specific Risks |
|---------------|-----|----------|----------------|
| **Lowest Risk** | Levetiracetam | 2-3% | Preferred; confirmed safe in 2024 Stanford study |
| **Lowest Risk** | Lamotrigine | 2-3% | Preferred; no NDD risk increase |
| **Low Risk** | Oxcarbazepine | 2-3% | Alternative option per 2024 guidelines |
| **Low Risk** | Eslicarbazepine | Limited data | Similar profile to OXC; use with caution |
| **Moderate Risk** | Carbamazepine | 4-6% | Neural tube defects, 1.25x autism risk |
| **High Risk** | Phenobarbital | 4.4% cardiac | Highest cardiac malformation risk |
| **High Risk** | Topiramate | 3-5% | Oral clefts; 2.5x intellectual disability |
| **Highest Risk** | Valproate | 5-15% | **CONTRAINDICATED** - 30-40% NDD risk |

*MCM = Major Congenital Malformations; NDD = Neurodevelopmental Disorders*

### 4.1.2 Neurodevelopmental Outcomes (2024 Evidence)

| ASM | Autism Spectrum Disorder | Intellectual Disability | ADHD | Lower IQ |
|-----|--------------------------|------------------------|------|----------|
| **Valproate** | 30-40% NDD risk overall | Significantly increased | Increased | Dose-dependent |

| **Levetiracetam** | No significant increase | No significant increase | No significant increase | No |
| **Oxcarbazepine** | Limited data, appears safe | Limited data, appears safe | — | No |

**2024 Stanford Study Findings:**
- Lamotrigine and levetiracetam confirmed safe for pregnancy
- No difference in verbal abilities at age 6 between children of women with/without epilepsy when on LTG or LEV

### 4.1.3 Pregnancy Management Protocol (2024)

```
PRE-CONCEPTION (Ideal: 6-12 months before)
├── Review ASM: Switch from VPA/TPM/PB to LTG, LEV, or OXC
├── Optimize to lowest effective dose for seizure control
├── Folic acid: ≥0.4 mg/day (4-5 mg/day if on enzyme inducers)
├── Genetic counseling if SCN1A+ or family history
├── Discuss pregnancy registry enrollment (NAAED, EURAP)
└── Counsel: "Do NOT stop ASM without medical guidance"

FIRST TRIMESTER
├── Continue effective ASM; do NOT switch during pregnancy if stable
├── If on VPA/TPM and newly pregnant: individualized risk discussion
│   └── Switching may be more risky than continuing in some cases
├── Monthly ASM level monitoring (especially LTG — levels drop 40-60%)
├── Folic acid continuation
└── Detailed fetal ultrasound at 11-14 weeks (NT scan)

SECOND/THIRD TRIMESTER
├── ASM level monitoring every 4-8 weeks
├── Dose adjustment: Increase LTG if levels drop significantly
├── Anatomy scan at 18-22 weeks
├── Growth scans if on enzyme inducers
└── Continue folic acid through at least first trimester

PERIPARTUM
├── Plan delivery location with neurology input
├── IV access for ASM if seizure risk high
├── Continue ASM throughout labor; do not skip doses
├── Vitamin K 10 mg IM to neonate if on enzyme inducers
└── Seizure action plan for labor team

POSTPARTUM
├── If dose was increased during pregnancy → reduce within 2-3 weeks
├── Monitor LTG levels (rise rapidly postpartum)
├── Breastfeeding: Generally safe with most ASMs
│   ├── Safe: LTG, LEV, VPA, CBZ, OXC
│   └── Caution: PB (sedation), high-dose BZDs
└── Sleep deprivation counseling (seizure trigger)
```

### 4.1.4 Preferred Combinations in Pregnancy

| Combination | Evidence | MCM Risk |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Lamotrigine + Levetiracetam** | 2024 duotherapy study | 60% lower than VPA monotherapy |
| **LTG or LEV monotherapy** | Preferred | 2-3% |
| **Avoid:** VPA + any ASM | — | Additive teratogenic risk |
| **Avoid:** TPM + any ASM | — | Additive teratogenic risk |
| **Avoid:** VPA + CBZ + TPM | — | Highest risk combinations |

### 4.1.5 Key 2024 Guideline Warnings

> ⚠️ **Valproic Acid:** Associated with highest risk of neural tube defects (1.4%) and 30-40% risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. **Avoid if at all possible** in people who may become pregnant.

> ⚠️ **Topiramate:** FDA and MHRA (June 2024) issued Pregnancy Prevention Programme requirements. Should not be used in women of childbearing potential unless conditions are fulfilled.

> ⚠️ **Do Not Stop ASM:** Stopping medication during pregnancy may increase seizure frequency, which may harm both parent and fetus. Uncontrolled generalized tonic-clonic seizures carry significant fetal risk.

## 4.2 Elderly (≥65 years)

### 4.2.1 Epidemiology

- Epilepsy is the **third most common neurologic diagnosis** in older adults (after dementia and stroke)
- Highest incidence and prevalence of epilepsy is in this age group
- Most new-onset seizures are focal in origin

|-----|------------|----------------|
| **Levetiracetam** | No hepatic metabolism, minimal interactions, IV available | Psychiatric effects (irritability), renal dosing required |
| **Lamotrigine** | Good tolerability, minimal cognitive effects, mood stabilizing | Slow titration required, rash risk |
| **Gabapentin** | No hepatic metabolism, no drug interactions | Renal dosing, TID dosing, peripheral edema |
| **Lacosamide** | Good tolerability, BID dosing, IV available | PR prolongation—avoid in cardiac conduction disorders |

| Lamotrigine | 25 mg daily | 25 mg daily | 100-200 mg/day | Same titration; often lower maintenance sufficient |
| Gabapentin | 300 mg TID | 100-300 mg daily | Based on CrCl | TID dosing often impractical |
| Lacosamide | 50 mg BID | 50 mg BID | 300 mg/day | ECG monitoring recommended |

| **Topiramate** | Cognitive slowing, word-finding difficulty | LEV, LTG |
| **Valproate** | Tremor (mimics Parkinson's), weight gain, thrombocytopenia, encephalopathy | LEV, LTG |

### 4.2.5 Special Considerations

- **Polypharmacy:** Prefer LEV, GBP, PGB (minimal drug interactions)
- **Falls risk:** Avoid sedating ASMs (PB, BZDs); consider bone health
- **Cognitive concerns:** Prefer LTG, LEV; avoid TPM, PHT, PB
- **Cardiac disease:** Avoid LCM, CBZ, PHT in conduction disorders
